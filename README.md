**Smarter Real Estate Investment Decisions Through Data**

---

## Project Overview

### The Problem

Real estate is one of the largest financial decisions most people make, yet the Buy vs Rent question is often answered through intuition rather than analysis. Investors lack tools to objectively compare the long-term financial outcomes of purchasing a property versus renting and investing the difference.

### The Solution

**BluePrint+** is a data-driven investment analysis tool for Indian residential real estate. It evaluates properties across major cities, computes 20-year wealth projections for both buying and renting scenarios, and provides clear recommendations based on terminal wealth comparison.

### How It Helps

- Transforms raw property data into actionable investment insights
- Removes emotional bias from the Buy vs Rent decision
- Enables city-level and property-level market comparison
- Provides natural language explanations via an AI assistant

## Investment Logic

### Buy vs Rent Comparison

The system evaluates two parallel financial scenarios over a 20-year horizon:

**Buying Scenario:**

- Deploy down payment as property equity
- Pay monthly EMI over loan tenure
- Property appreciates annually
- Terminal wealth = Appreciated property value − Total cost paid

**Renting Scenario:**

- Invest down payment in equity/mutual funds
- Invest monthly savings (EMI − Rent) continuously
- Investments grow at market returns
- Terminal wealth = Total investment corpus

**Decision:** The scenario yielding higher terminal wealth determines the recommendation.

### Assumptions

| Parameter             | Value                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Down Payment          | 20% of property value |
| Loan Interest Rate    | 8.5% per annum        |
| Loan Tenure           | 20 years              |
| Property Appreciation | 5% per annum          |
| Investment Returns    | 10% per annum         |
| Rent Escalation       | 3% per annum          |

_These are heuristic assumptions for comparative analysis purposes._

## AI Assistant — Scope & Guardrails

### What the AI Does

- Interprets natural language queries about properties
- Retrieves relevant records from the precomputed dataset
- Explains investment metrics and recommendations in plain language
- Provides city-level and property-level insights

### What the AI Does NOT Do

- Perform financial calculations or projections
- Generate numbers not present in the dataset
- Predict future market movements
- Provide personalized investment advice

### Grounding

All AI responses are grounded in the static dataset. The assistant uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant property records before generating explanations. No values are hallucinated.
